**Q1)** Define a struct person as follows:
``` C
struct person{
	int id;
	char *name;
	int age;
	int height;
	int weight;
};
```
Write a menu driven program to read the data of 'n' students from a file and store them in a dynamically allocated array of struct person. Implement a min-heap or max-heap and its operations based on the menu options

**Sample IP/OP** :
MAIN MENUE (HEAP)
1. Read Data
2. Create Min Heap based on the age
3. Create Max heap based on the weight
4. Display weight of the youngest person
5. Insert a new person into the Min-heap
6. Delete the oldest person
7. Exit
